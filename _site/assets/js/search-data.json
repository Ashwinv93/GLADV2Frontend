            "content": "College Board 2021 MCQ Review . I scored a 61/70 . Question 9 . stats . Photo of question . . My corrections/reflections: Answer C is incorrect because all digital data is represented as a sequence of bits. While you can change the audio data this way of changing it may not be applicable for all options. Answer B is correct because the audio signal is in fact stored in bits based on the measurements of the signal. . Question 18 . stats . Photo of question . . My corrections/reflections: Option D is incorrect because if devices C and F fail, D can still communicate with H through B, then E or G. Answer C is correct because If devices B and F fail, then devices E, G, and H will not be able to communicate A, C, D, and I. Therefore, device A will be unable to reach device G. . Question 33 . stats . Photo of question . . My corrections/reflections: Option C is inncorect because algorithm is proportional to n^2 which is considered a reasonable amount. Algorithm 2 is still proportional to n^2 so its still a reasonable amount of time. This is a heuristic approach since it uses an approx solution to figure out that algorithm 1 doesnt run in reasonable time. . Question 50 . stats . Photo of question . . My corrections/reflections: I picked option B which is incorrect because only one key is used for symmetric encryption so it should be kept secret to prevent hacking. Option A is correct since symmetric encryption does only use one key and since the key is valuable for accessing a lot of info it should be kept secret. . Question 55 . stats . Photo of question . . My corrections/reflections: I selected option A, but it is not correct the output of the code segment is simply the original list so it does not transform it. Option C is correct signs it removes the last variable of the list then reassigns it to the first element of the list. . Question 57 . stats . Photo of question . . My correction/reflection: I selected option D, but this option is incorrect since running p on one processor takes 30 sec and runnning the rest on another takes 45. Therefore this one will take 45 seconds instead of 40. Option a is correct since running p and q together and R and S together will result in the solution taking 40 seconds which is what is needed. . Question 59 . stats . Photo of question . . My correction/reflection: I selected option D, but this option is incorrect since running p on one processor takes 30 sec and runnning the rest on another takes 45. Therefore this one will take 45 seconds instead of 40. Option a is correct since running p and q together and R and S together will result in the solution taking 40 seconds which is what is needed. .",

            "content": "What is Clash Royale? . Clash Royale is a popular mobile strategy game developed by Supercell. In Clash Royale, players build and customize their own decks of cards featuring various characters, spells, and defenses inspired by the Clash of Clans universe. The goal of the game is to destroy your opponent’s towers while defending your own. Players deploy their cards strategically on a battlefield in real-time to outmaneuver their opponents and claim victory. It combines elements of card collection, tower defense, and real-time strategy gameplay, making it both engaging and challenging for players of all ages. In a game you need to spend elixer to deploy a card(characters or spells). Throuhgout the game this will regenerate. Elixir is like the energy you use to play cards in battles. You start with a certain amount of elixir, and it gradually fills up over time. Each card you play costs a certain amount of elixir, so you have to decide when to use your cards wisely. You want to make sure you have enough elixir to defend against your opponent’s attacks while also launching your own. . Our Project . Our projects contain feautres relating to certain aspects of the game. There are databases displaying user information, tournaments, news, and also a simulation of deck creation. .",

            "content": "College Board 2021 MCQ Review . I scored a 61/70 . Question 9 . stats . Photo of question . . My corrections/reflections: Answer C is incorrect because all digital data is represented as a sequence of bits. While you can change the audio data this way of changing it may not be applicable for all options. Answer B is correct because the audio signal is in fact stored in bits based on the measurements of the signal. . Question 18 . stats . Photo of question . . My corrections/reflections: Option D is incorrect because if devices C and F fail, D can still communicate with H through B, then E or G. Answer C is correct because If devices B and F fail, then devices E, G, and H will not be able to communicate A, C, D, and I. Therefore, device A will be unable to reach device G. . Question 33 . stats . Photo of question . . My corrections/reflections: Option C is inncorect because algorithm is proportional to n^2 which is considered a reasonable amount. Algorithm 2 is still proportional to n^2 so its still a reasonable amount of time. This is a heuristic approach since it uses an approx solution to figure out that algorithm 1 doesnt run in reasonable time. . Question 50 . stats . Photo of question . . My corrections/reflections: I picked option B which is incorrect because only one key is used for symmetric encryption so it should be kept secret to prevent hacking. Option A is correct since symmetric encryption does only use one key and since the key is valuable for accessing a lot of info it should be kept secret. . Question 55 . stats . Photo of question . . My corrections/reflections: I selected option A, but it is not correct the output of the code segment is simply the original list so it does not transform it. Option C is correct signs it removes the last variable of the list then reassigns it to the first element of the list. . Question 57 . stats . Photo of question . . My correction/reflection: I selected option D, but this option is incorrect since running p on one processor takes 30 sec and runnning the rest on another takes 45. Therefore this one will take 45 seconds instead of 40. Option a is correct since running p and q together and R and S together will result in the solution taking 40 seconds which is what is needed. . Question 59 . stats . Photo of question . . My correction/reflection: I selected option D, but this option is incorrect since running p on one processor takes 30 sec and runnning the rest on another takes 45. Therefore this one will take 45 seconds instead of 40. Option a is correct since running p and q together and R and S together will result in the solution taking 40 seconds which is what is needed. .",

          "content": "What is Clash Royale? . Clash Royale is a popular mobile strategy game developed by Supercell. In Clash Royale, players build and customize their own decks of cards featuring various characters, spells, and defenses inspired by the Clash of Clans universe. The goal of the game is to destroy your opponent’s towers while defending your own. Players deploy their cards strategically on a battlefield in real-time to outmaneuver their opponents and claim victory. It combines elements of card collection, tower defense, and real-time strategy gameplay, making it both engaging and challenging for players of all ages. In a game you need to spend elixer to deploy a card(characters or spells). Throuhgout the game this will regenerate. Elixir is like the energy you use to play cards in battles. You start with a certain amount of elixir, and it gradually fills up over time. Each card you play costs a certain amount of elixir, so you have to decide when to use your cards wisely. You want to make sure you have enough elixir to defend against your opponent’s attacks while also launching your own. . Our Project . Our projects contain feautres relating to certain aspects of the game. There are databases displaying user information, tournaments, news, and also a simulation of deck creation. .
