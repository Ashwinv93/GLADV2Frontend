This is a clash royale project (a popular game in the youth) and there are many portions to this project. Users are able to login and have accounts in which they can store decks that they like using in the game. The users are also able to open chests in which they unlock cards they can use in their deck. There is also a quiz in which the user gets a recomended deck to them based on their answer choices. The last feature is an event board that shows tournaments and oother events that are happening in the game with a search bar included.
