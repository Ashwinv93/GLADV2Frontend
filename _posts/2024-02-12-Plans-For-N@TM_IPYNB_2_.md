## Ashwin Plans
- I would like to add a reset button that will clear the contairer for the cards, and bring back the chest, allowing the user to open it again.
- I also would like to add two different chests. One would be the golden chest, which only allows epics and lower to be pulled. Only 4 cards. The other chest would be a lightnight chest which give 10 cards all epic and above. Depending on what the user clicks on different functions will run to populate the container.
- If I have time I will add a collection system so people can save their favorite cards.

## Licoln Plans
- I want to be able to improve my quiz by making a cards.py in the model for the backend, a card.py in the Api in the backend. I want to do this because after the deck recommendation is given, it will give statistics on all the cards by getting it from the backend.

## Dantes Plans
- For my code, I need to work on integrating the backend for storing the decks you create allowing the user to return to the decks they created. Also, I could add a way to favorite the specific decks and delete others. Also, I could connect lincolns feature to mine by automatically making the deck that the survey gives into the deck collection.

## Gurshawns plans
- i want to fix my nba database by showing all player data in a table, and when you search a table will be generated based on the stats currently shown. the user will have the option to add players to a team and reset the team
