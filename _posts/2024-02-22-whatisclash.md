## What is Clash Royale?
Clash Royale is a popular mobile strategy game developed by Supercell. In Clash Royale, players build and customize their own decks of cards featuring various characters, spells, and defenses inspired by the Clash of Clans universe. The goal of the game is to destroy your opponent's towers while defending your own. Players deploy their cards strategically on a battlefield in real-time to outmaneuver their opponents and claim victory. It combines elements of card collection, tower defense, and real-time strategy gameplay, making it both engaging and challenging for players of all ages. In a game you need to spend elixer to deploy a card(characters or spells). Throuhgout the game this will regenerate. Elixir is like the energy you use to play cards in battles. You start with a certain amount of elixir, and it gradually fills up over time. Each card you play costs a certain amount of elixir, so you have to decide when to use your cards wisely. You want to make sure you have enough elixir to defend against your opponent's attacks while also launching your own.
