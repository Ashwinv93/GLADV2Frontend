My corrections/reflections: Answer C is incorrect because all digital data is represented as a sequence of bits. While you can change the audio data this way of changing it may not be applicable for all options. Answer B is correct because the audio signal is in fact stored in bits based on the measurements of the signal.

My corrections/reflections: Option D is incorrect because if devices C and F fail, D can still communicate with H through B, then E or G. Answer C is correct because If devices B and F fail, then devices E, G, and H will not be able to communicate A, C, D, and I. Therefore, device A will be unable to reach device G.

My corrections/reflections: Option C is inncorect because algorithm is proportional to n^2 which is considered a reasonable amount. Algorithm 2 is still proportional to n^2 so its still a reasonable amount of time. This is a heuristic approach since it uses an approx solution to figure out that algorithm 1 doesnt run in reasonable time.

My corrections/reflections: I picked option B which is incorrect because only one key is used for symmetric encryption so it should be kept secret to prevent hacking. Option A is correct since symmetric encryption does only use one key and since the key is valuable for accessing a lot of info it should be kept secret.  

## Question 55

My corrections/reflections: I selected option A, but it is not correct the output of the code segment is simply the original list so it does not transform it. Option C is correct signs it removes the last variable of the list then reassigns it to the first element of the list.

My correction/reflection: I selected option D, but this option is incorrect since running p on one processor takes 30 sec and runnning the rest on another takes 45. Therefore this one will take 45 seconds instead of 40. Option a is correct since running p and q together and R and S together will result in the solution taking 40 seconds which is what is needed. 

## Question 59
