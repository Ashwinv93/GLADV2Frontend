    "The game clash royal is a mobile where two people play against eachother with decks of 8 cards. The cards each have different satistics and abilitys. I aim to build a user friendly interface that lets you drag cards from a collection of all the 118 cards into 8 slots for your deck. Once the deck is build it will display the average elixer cost of the cost, and some other statistics if possible.\n",

Upon clicking on one of them you will be able to read and review comments about this specific deck. Additionally there will be a rating system where each user leaves a /5 rating and this data can be averaged for sorting. A function will go through each comment to find keywords or characters that indicate a rating. In the \"publicly shared\" tab ther will be the option to view by newest uploaded, most popular, and highst rated.\n",

    "Coding Clash Royale cards onto a website aligns with the College Board's Computer Science Principles requirements by demonstrating understanding of programming concepts, algorithms, and data representation. It showcases computational thinking, problem-solving skills, and the ability to design interactive user interfaces, meeting the criteria for the creative development of a project in the context of CSP coursework. I also plan to implement a feature where clicking on a Clash Royale card reveals its information involves using event-driven programming, a key CSP concept. I will do this by employing HTML, SASS, and JavaScript. JavaScript handles the click event, triggering the display of card details. This not only demonstrates proficiency in web development but also showcases knowledge of variables, functions, and conditional statementsâ€”integral components of CSP. Additionally, I can explore data structures to efficiently store and retrieve card information.\n",

Vance is specific will work on the search algorithm and the dragibility of the cards as well as their individual code and information. Also, me and vance together will work on the user interface with the commenting and sharing the decks you create. I will work on databasing and storing all of the card data in the back end since it is all stored temporarily in the front end. Also, I will partially work on the login and databasing all of the unique user info like comments and decks. Vance's individual feature the dragibility of the cards working off of Ashwins feature. My feature can be the log in system."
